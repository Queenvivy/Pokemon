# POKEMON DATA STORY AND VISUALIZATION

## POKEMON DATA STORY
     
Once upon a time, in the world of Pokémon, there were countless trainers and creatures living in harmony.These trainers embarked on journeys to become Pokémon Masters, capturing and training various Pokémon species along the way.In this data story, we will explore some interesting insights and trends within the Pokémon universe

### POKEMON TYPES
   
i took a look at the distribution of Pokémon types. Pokémons can be categorized into different types such as water,normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric,and many more. By analyzing the data, i identified which types are the most common and which are the rarest.and in this dataset we realised that water types are most common while flying types are rare.

  ### POKEMON SPEED
  i analyzed the attributes and characteristics of Pokémon, such as their stats and abilities.i started by comparing their speed abilities to know which of the pokemon has the highest speed stat which will help trainers know exactly what they are capturing,Regieleki despite having only type 1(electric) has the highest Speed amongst all the Pokemons at 200, followed by Deoxys Speed Forme with type 1 as well(psychic) at 180.a pokemon needs speed to dodge attacks from opponents in order to defend itself and also needs speed to attack faster.
the fastest pokemon strikes first, the turn order is decided by the speed stats,by so doing we can gain insights into the strategies used in battles.

### SPECIAL DEFENSE AND HITPOINT
 I noticed also that Eternatus Eternamax has the highest sp.Def at 250, and also has the highest hitpoint at 255. 
sp.Def makes a pokemon resistant to hits,while good hitpoints allows the pokemon to take a large extent of hit before it faints, even if it's a sp.Atk.so eternatus having the highest Sp.def and hitpoint really gives him huge advantage.
  
  ### ATTACK AND DEFENSE
   thereafter i decided to see which pokemon has a good attack and defense stat,,Mewtwo Mega Mewtwo X  has the highest Attack at 190 and defense at 100 which (defense)isn't that great, it means that he has a good attack advantage but can barely defend himself
then we have Groudon primal Groudon with Attack of 180 and defense of 160, which is way better than what Mewtwo Mega Mewtwo X has,
a pokemon with good attack and defense is better than one with just a good attack so in this case we will consider Groudon primal Groudon first

### INDIVIDUAL STRENGHT
   Furthermore i also analyzed pokemons based on their individual strenghts,eg. from this dataset, i managed to bring out all the characters with maximun capability in each stat. when making battle strategies which involves picking/capturing the right guy for each stats.
   
   HITPOINT:: Blissey and  Eternatus Eternamax  has the highest hitpoint of 255.

DEFENSE:: Eternatus Eternamax with two types,poison and dragon has the highest defense of 250.

ATTACK:: Mewtwo Mega Mewtwo X has the  highest attack of 190.

SPEED::Regieleki has the highest speed of 200. 


### TOP 5 OVERALL STAT
Lastly i compared the top5 pokemons with great stats using the total stats. 
Eternatus Eternamax has high stats in every angle but Attack, so the tendency of him causing  damage to other pokemon is dependent on their level of defense,if the opponent has a high defense level,then eternatus eternamax's tendency of causing damages to it is very low and vice versa.
looking at the other 5 pokemon stats,we need to check for the pokemon that has the most balanced stat and not just being the highest with total and from our dataset, Mewtwo Mega Mewtwo Y, his entire stats are great except for his defense which he made up for with Sp.Def.
followed by Groudon primal Groudon,Kyogre primal Kyogre,Mewtwo Mega Mewtwo X and lastly Raquaza Mega Rayquaza.
now with these stats, we were able to bring out top 6,pokemons with great stats for battle.
